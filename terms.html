    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>All work is hand-made. Small variations are part of the craft.</p>

    <h2>Quotes &amp; Approvals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Estimates are provided by email.</li>
      <li>Work begins after we both agree in writing (email is fine).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Deposits &amp; Refunds</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Deposits are non-refundable once paid, as materials and preparation begin immediately.</strong></li>
      <li>Deposits are applied to your final total.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Payments</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>This site does not collect card details.</li>
      <li>After approval, I’ll send a deposit invoice or payment link by email.</li>
      <li>Remaining balance is due before delivery or shipping.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Turnaround</h2>
    <p>Timelines are estimates. Handwork can shift with complexity and material availability.</p>

    <h2>Shipping &amp; Risk</h2>
    <p>Shipping timelines are set by the carrier. Damage or loss is handled through carrier claims.</p>

    <h2>Warranty &amp; Repairs</h2>
    <p>If there’s a workmanship issue, I’ll make it right within a reasonable period after delivery.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>West Virginia, USA.</p>
