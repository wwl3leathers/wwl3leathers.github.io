  <h2>Module 1A — Player Core Systems</h2>
  MODULE 1A — Player Core Systems

Purpose

Rules that apply to all players, regardless of class.

⸻

1. Player Resources
	•	Health (HP) is not a spendable resource.
	•	Mana and Stamina are the only spendable resources.
	•	A character’s Primary Class determines which resource all abilities use.
	•	Movement actions may consume the primary resource.

⸻

2. Resource Bar Structure

Each spendable resource uses a Two-Bar System:
	•	Active Resource Bar
	•	Reserve Resource Bar (33% of maximum)

Rules:
	•	Resource expenditure draws from Reserve first
	•	No passive regeneration of Active or Reserve Bars
	•	Magical healing cannot restore the Reserve Bar
	•	Reserve refills only via:
	•	Consumables
	•	Safe Zones

When Reserve is empty → Cracked State
	•	Cracked resources cannot refill until Safe Zone access or consumable use.

⸻

3. Casting & Movement
	•	Cast Time = 0 → Instant Cast
	•	All Instant Cast abilities may be used while moving
	•	Any Cast Time greater than 0 requires stationary casting
	•	Cast time reduction cannot reduce below 0
	•	Instant cast status is binary (no partial movement)

Status: STRUCTURAL — Pending Final Reconfirmation

⸻

4. Universal Buff Rules
	•	Weak Buff → +15%
	•	Strong Buff → +45%

Rules:
	•	Buffs are category-based
	•	Buffs of the same category do not stack
	•	Reapplying a buff refreshes duration only
	•	Weak never upgrades to Strong
	•	Strong never downgrades to Weak

⸻

5. Mechanical Damage Types

Talvaren uses exactly four (4) mechanical damage types:
	•	Physical
	•	Magic
	•	Arcane
	•	Mental

All Mandala / elemental terms (Light, Fire, Ice, etc.) are flavor only and have no mechanical damage, resistance, or weakness math.

⸻

6. Damage Magnitude Placeholders

Each mechanical damage type uses four magnitude tiers:
	•	Weak
	•	Standard
	•	Strong
	•	Major

Rules:
	•	These are relative tiers, not numbers
	•	Numeric tuning is deferred to tables
	•	No stacking magnitude math
	•	No sub-tiers
	•	Same magnitude = same budget everywhere

⸻

7. Mental Damage Special Rule

Mental damage is effect-first, not damage-first.
	•	Deals minimal or zero HP damage
	•	Magnitudes define duration and severity, not damage

Tier meaning:
	•	Weak → very short, minor disruption
	•	Standard → short, meaningful disruption
	•	Strong → long, high-impact disruption
	•	Major → very long or encounter-defining effect

Mental effects still obey:
	•	No immunity rules
	•	CC-break rules
	•	Refresh-not-stack rules

⸻

8. Primary Resource Regeneration

Primary resources (Mana, Stamina) do not regenerate naturally.

There is:
	•	No passive regeneration
	•	No out-of-combat regeneration
	•	No stat-based regeneration
	•	No class-based regeneration

Resources are restored only via:
	•	Consumables
	•	Safe Zones

Status: ACTIVE — Unlocked for evaluation

⸻

9. Reserve Bar Regeneration

Status: OPEN DESIGN NOTE
	•	A very slow Reserve regeneration may be allowed in the future
	•	Not decided
	•	Not implemented
	•	Not implied

If allowed:
	•	Would be extremely slow
	•	Would never replace consumables
	•	Would never operate in combat
	•	Exists only to reduce hard-dead expedition states

⸻

10. Sprint & Movement Authority
	•	Sprint available at Level 1
	•	Sprint is an exertive action
	•	Sprint drains Active Stamina
	•	Sprint may drain Reserve
	•	Sprint never restores resources
	•	Sprint disabled if Stamina is Cracked
	•	Walking and normal movement remain free
	•	Encumbrance modifies stamina efficiency

No other module may redefine sprint behavior.

Status: STRUCTURAL — Pending Stress Testing

⸻

11. Dual-Class Rules
	•	Maximum of two classes per character
	•	Primary Class:
	•	Defines resource type
	•	Defines scaling model
	•	Secondary Class:
	•	Grants abilities only

All abilities use the Primary Resource.

⸻

12. Primary Resource Law
	•	HP is a life resource only
	•	No ability ever costs HP
	•	HP loss occurs only through damage or world consequences

There are:
	•	No mixed-cost abilities
	•	No dual-resource abilities
	•	No exceptions

⸻

13. Primary Resource Class Split (LOCKED)

Mana-Primary Classes (8):
	•	Wizard
	•	Necromancer
	•	Druid
	•	Priest
	•	Jeweler
	•	Alchemist
	•	Tailor
	•	Scribe

Stamina-Primary Classes (8):
	•	Warrior
	•	Paladin
	•	Executioner
	•	Rogue
	•	Smith
	•	Cook
	•	Laborer
	•	Tamer

All abilities — combat, utility, profession, and dual-class — consume the primary resource.

⸻

14. Core Stats & Progression Rules
	•	Six primary stats: STR, CON, DEX, INT, WIS, ART
	•	Beginning stats depend on size; “Average” begins at 8
	•	Level 1:
	•	+20 stat points
	•	Size-based min/max apply (Level 1 only)
	•	Post-Level 1:
	•	+2 stat points per level
	•	Max +1 per stat per level
	•	No stat caps

Attribute effects are per-point, not per-level.

⸻

15. Attribute Effects (Per Point)
	•	STR → Stamina Max
	•	WIS → Mana Max
	•	ART → Stamina efficiency + Stamina Max
	•	CON → HP per point (retroactive)
	•	DEX → Physical mitigation
	•	INT → Spell interaction logic

⸻

16. Safe Zones
	•	Allow recovery and logistical action
	•	Do not prevent consequences

Aggro rules:
	•	A mob pulled into a Safe Zone remains aggroed only to:
	•	The pulling player
	•	Any players who attack it or heal attackers

⸻

17. Literacy & UI Gates
	•	INT ≤ 10 → Cannot read
	•	INT ≥ 11 → Literacy enabled
	•	WIS < 11 → Compass disabled
	•	Symbol-based signage still functions

⸻

18. Scrolls & Writs

Scrolls
	•	Spell-adjacent, single-use items
	•	Instant cast
	•	Consume mana
	•	Reference base spell only unless class-unlocked
	•	Blocked while:
	•	Silenced
	•	Underwater
	•	In storm biomes

Writs
	•	Non-magical systemic documents
	•	Do not consume mana

Rules:
	•	Scrolls and writs are categorically distinct
	•	No item may function as both
	•	Scrolls and writs cannot be chained

⸻

19. Death & Soul Logic
	•	Spirit Wells:
	•	Resurrection
	•	Identification access
	•	Map study
	•	Graveyards
	•	Two bindable respawn locations (primary + secondary)

⸻

20. Field Kit (Universal Slot)
	•	All characters possess one Field Kit slot
	•	Universal, class-agnostic
	•	Not gear, inventory, or weapon
	•	World-interaction utility only

Field Pull System
	•	Once per 3-hour in-game day:
	•	Grants one random utility consumable
	•	Low quality
	•	Single-use
	•	Non-scaling
	•	Non-sellable
	•	Non-damaging
	•	No combat debuffs
	•	May stack naturally

Constraints:
	•	No stat bonuses
	•	No durability repair
	•	Does not replace Smith repairs or towns
	•	Professions may unlock interactions through it

Fishing Pole is the only equip-required tool unless patched.

⸻

21. Encumbrance Authority Clarification
	•	Equipment defines weight
	•	Player systems define consequences
	•	No equipment module may define stamina regeneration or sprint rules

⸻

Status Summary
	•	Locked: Primary Resource Class Split
	•	Active (Unlocked): Resource Regeneration Rule
	•	Open: Reserve Bar Regen
	•	Structural / Pending: Casting & Sprint Interaction

<section id="holding-temp">
  <h2>Holding — Temp</h2>
  PATCH-HOLDING-OWNER-DECISIONS-001

Status: HOLDING — Parked, No Resolution Attempted

Scope: World Systems / Economy / Design Doctrine

⸻

1. Multi-Account Route Optimization

Affects: World Systems / Economy

Multi-account coordination used to:
	•	Observe caravan timing
	•	Optimize personal logistics
	•	Share route knowledge

This behavior is acknowledged and intentionally not restricted.

No systemic countermeasures are defined at this time.

Status: HOLDING

⸻

2. Safe Zone Camping Behavior

Affects: World Design / Zone Placement

Players may congregate at Safe Zones (including Caravan Route Posts) for:
	•	Comfort
	•	Safety
	•	Social or logistical reasons

Mitigation through world design choices (content placement, value density) is acknowledged but not systematized.

Status: HOLDING

⸻

3. Caravan-Edge Death Exploit (Edge Case)

Affects: Caravan Protection / Death Handling

Highly unlikely scenario:
	•	Player attempts to die intentionally at the boundary of caravan protection to probe respawn behavior

No explicit system guard is added at this time.

Status: HOLDING

⸻

4. Exploit & Emergent Play Doctrine

Affects: Design Doctrine (formerly Module 10 reference)

This doctrine:
	•	Governs design intent and evaluation only
	•	Introduces no mechanics
	•	Does not override rules unless explicitly referenced by a future patch

Status: HOLDING — Intent Layer Only

⸻

5. Material Costs for Spell Scrolls

Affects: Scribe Scroll Creation

Material requirements for spell scrolls are explicitly deferred:
	•	Reagents
	•	Quantities
	•	Rarity tiers
	•	Special components

To be defined in a later patch.

Status: HOLDING

⸻

6. Owner Decision Required — Parked Topics

No resolution attempted. Items are parked, not discarded.
	•	Final destination of mount travel routing logic (likely Module 4)
	•	Whether mount lists are duplicated in a global registry or referenced only
	•	Future interaction between mounts and caravans beyond logistics role

Status: HOLDING — OWNER DECISION REQUIRED

⸻

7. Canonical Overrides (Valid Patch Content)

These overrides are acknowledged as valid, but placement and integration remain pending.
	•	Mob taxonomy replaces prior tier-based assumptions
	•	Resistance system simplified to four categories
	•	Loot logic supersedes older humanoid / fauna drop rules
	•	Respawn logic overrides prior global respawn assumptions
	•	Unique item use-it-or-lose-it rule restated

Status: HOLDING — INTEGRATION PENDING

⸻

8. Owner Decision Required — Rule Placement Conflicts

No resolution attempted.
	•	Placement of Use-It-Or-Lose-It (10-day rule) vs existing global True Unique rule (possible overlap)
	•	Treatment of Halfling resistance modifier (race-based exception intersects Module 1A)
	•	Scope of Major NPC lootability vs governance / enforcement module

Status: HOLDING — OWNER DECISION REQUIRED

⸻

9. Additional Parked Interactions

No resolution attempted.
	•	Interaction between Wayfinder’s Beacon and teleport restrictions
	•	Scope of Deep Delver Markets relative to Vast Below governance
	•	Relationship between Zone Cluster soft bands and XP curve tables
	•	Status of UNIVERSAL PRINT FORMAT DIRECTIVE (process vs canon interaction)

“Kobold Lost-and-Found is flavor-only and intentionally non-mechanical.”

Status: HOLDING

⸻

HOLDING SUMMARY
	•	This section contains no active mechanics
	•	It preserves:
	•	Known edge cases
	•	Owner decisions
	•	Deferred integrations
	•	Design doctrine
	•	Nothing here is implied, enforced, or implemented
