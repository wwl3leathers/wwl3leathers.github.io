 PLAYER-FACING LORE

SECTION I — PLAYER FACING LORE

TALVAREN — LOCKED CANON EXTRACT

⸻

CORE WORLD PRINCIPLE (LOCKED)

Talvaren is a world where systems exist to support long-term immersion, player freedom, and lived consequence rather than spectacle.
All races, professions, and mechanics must be:
	•	engine-feasible
	•	low CPU
	•	readable without tutorials
	•	culturally grounded rather than trope-driven

⸻

UNDEAD — PLAYABLE RACE (LOCKED)

Conceptual Definition

Undead are post-mortem citizens, not monsters. Death is an event, not a moral judgment.

Undead emerged prominently following the eradication of the Arachni, when survival demanded medical solutions beyond living physiology.

Social Standing
	•	Fully accepted as a valid race
	•	Participate in all professions
	•	Require periodic physical maintenance rather than healing

Player Creation — Undead Sliders (LOW CPU, KISS MODE)

Undead customization is limited to four options, chosen to avoid animation or combat complexity:
	1.	Skin Tone / Condition
	•	Natural pallor → ashen → desiccated
	2.	Visible Damage
	•	None → minor tears → exposed bone segments
	3.	Structural Loss (Cosmetic Only)
	•	Missing flesh on limbs, jawline, or torso
(No spine, leg, or locomotion-affecting deformities permitted)
	4.	Restoration State
	•	Recently maintained → neglected → visibly repaired

No deformation may affect hitboxes, gait, or equipment usage.

⸻

NECROMANCY — PROFESSION (LOCKED)

Cultural Definition

Necromancy is a medical and restorative discipline, not a taboo art.

Necromancers arose historically as doctors and repair specialists for Undead populations. Their work emphasizes precision, restraint, and professionalism.

Visual & Cultural Rules
	•	Necromancers do not use ostentatious magical effects
	•	No glowing green necrotic energy as default
	•	Arcane work is subtle, implied through gesture, tools, and controlled light
	•	Attire is practical, modest, and role-appropriate

Necromancers are trusted civic professionals.

⸻

THERIAN — PLAYABLE RACE (RENAMED FROM GNOLL, LOCKED)

Canon Rename

All prior references to Gnoll are hereby replaced with Therian.
Gnoll lore is now Therian lore.

Racial Identity

Therians are animal-adjacent humanoids, not animal hybrids or caricatures.

They are defined by:
	•	Human body plan
	•	Canid-adjacent facial and structural traits
	•	Cultural diversity rather than species determinism

Base Species (LOCKED)

Desert Canid is the canonical Therian base.

This supports:
	•	fox-like
	•	jackal-like
	•	shepherd-like expressions
without branching skeletons or animation trees.

Player Customization (LOW CPU)

Therian customization is intentionally minimal:
	•	Single Primary Slider:
Canid Expression
(sleek → rugged → weathered)
	•	Secondary cosmetic options (fur color, pattern, thickness) are visual-only

Hard Restrictions
	•	No tails as default player features
(Tails may exist as cosmetic purchases)
	•	No animalistic limb structure
	•	No exaggerated muzzles or cartoon proportions

⸻

THERIAN DEVELOPMENTAL LORE (LOCKED)

Juvenile Traits

Therian children may display:
	•	ears without facial fur
	•	smooth skin
	•	tails (cosmetic/social, not mechanical)

Maturity Indicator

Facial fur growth is a sign of adulthood, not age alone.

Adolescence may include:
	•	patchy facial fur
	•	hairy ears or nose
	•	visible acne or uneven growth

No cultural rites or forced transitions are mandated.

⸻ SHADES — NON-PLAYABLE RACE (LOCKED)

Shades are canon global entities with history and identity.

They function as:
	•	persistent world presences
	•	narrative pressure valves
	•	comedy through contradiction

Shades are:
	•	legitimate
	•	non-playable
	•	never treated as jokes or monsters

Their humor emerges from interaction, not intent.

⸻

KOBOLDS — NON-PLAYABLE RACE (LOCKED)

Kobolds are world-glue entities.

They:
	•	occupy infrastructure gaps
	•	assist, persist, and over-commit
	•	are socially earnest to the point of inconvenience

They are not:
	•	disposable
	•	weak fodder
	•	parody creatures

Kobolds provide comedy through sincerity and loyalty.

⸻

EXPEDITIONS — WORLD SYSTEM (LOCKED)

Every city offers Profession Expeditions:
	•	available only to professional classes
	•	run three times daily
	•	allow non-combat characters access to resources

Expeditions are canon world infrastructure, not instanced side content.

⸻

SCRIBES — PROFESSION (LOCKED FOUNDATION)

	•	Scribes are the only source of zone maps
	•	Every zone contains three Anchors
	•	Anchors are natural or historical features (rocks, trees, cliffs, ruins)
	•	A zone map is only possible after all three Anchors are identified

Scribes may:
	•	sell map fragments
	•	locate the nearest unidentified Anchor

Zones may shift over time, requiring re-anchoring.

⸻

HUMOR PHILOSOPHY (LOCKED)

Talvaren allows humor without undermining stakes.

Comedy exists as:
	•	social friction
	•	contradiction
	•	earnest overcommitment

Not parody.
Not mockery.
Not genre collapse.

⸻

DESIGN META-AXIOM (LOCKED)

AI can model logic, but does not live consequences.
Humans live consequences, but forget structure.

Talvaren’s Lore Bible exists to preserve structure across resets, tools, and authorship.

⸻

NECROMANCY — CONTEXT & PRACTICE

Necromancy was never born of defiance or taboo.

It emerged in the Age following the eradication of the Arachni, when undeath spread faster than fear could manage it. Death itself had been altered—damaged, but not broken—and the world required specialists to understand what remained.

Necromancers arose as doctors, not tyrants.

Their earliest work focused on stabilizing the Undead: preventing degradation, restoring function, preserving identity, and ensuring that altered bodies remained inhabitable. What they practiced was not resurrection, but maintenance—the care of systems that no longer resolved on their own.

Over time, necromancy became institutional.

It is practiced openly, regulated by precedent and competence rather than moral decree. Necromancers do not judge the dead, command souls, or arbitrate fate. They repair, document, and correct failures where death does not behave as expected.

In desert regions, where preservation outpaces decay, necromancy found particular clarity. Bone lasts. Records endure. Structures built to outlive memory became natural centers for treatment and cataloging. What outsiders mistake for ceremony is, in truth, infrastructure.

Undead seeking necromantic care are not supplicants. They are patients.

Treatment is routine. Waiting rooms exist. Tools are standardized. Adjustments are made calmly, without spectacle. The presence of humor—vanity, impatience, personal habits—is not disrespectful. It is evidence that the system works.

Necromancy persists because it must.

Not because it is feared.
Not because it is forbidden.
But because reality, once damaged, does not heal itself.

(What the world believes to be accurate)

⸻ TALVAREN — WORLD OVERVIEW

Talvaren is a living world governed by intentional friction, deliberate scarcity, and consequence.

Convenience is rejected as default. Systems reinforce identity, choice, and responsibility.

There are no invisible walls. Access is blocked only by natural world conditions: patrol density, megafauna, ambient danger, weather, migration hazards, and biological limits.

Danger is biological, not artificial.

Size, race, and physicality matter. Beings are not scaled humans; they experience the world differently, socially and materially.

Literacy is not assumed.

Talvaren enforces boundaries through systems, not morality.

⸻

THE AGES (PUBLIC RECORD)

Talvaren is believed to be in the Sixth Age.

History is incomplete but stable. Empires rise and fall within understood bounds. Institutions replace fear. Ancient powers linger but are largely dormant.

PUBLIC RECORD — THE SEVEN AGES

AGE 1 — THE AGE OF DRAGONKIN
The greatest saturation of raw mana in world history. Dragonkin civilizations thrived. A forbidden resurrection ritual birthed the Nullbrand Revenant. Dragonkind enacted a sacrificial binding. Roughly one hundred dragons survived. Scholars believe this was the First Age.

AGE 2 — THE AGE OF PROSPERITY
A golden age of peace, expansion, and cultural development. Reckless experimentation awakened the Arachni.

AGE 3 — THE AGE OF SUBJUGATION
The Arachni claimed divine supremacy. Their dominion ended when they attempted to slay Vallinoraxistup. What followed was not a war. It was a reprimand.

AGE 4 — THE AGE OF THE LIVING DEAD
Death itself was altered. Undeath spread. Holy Purges followed. Death was damaged, not broken.

AGE 5 — THE AGE OF ACCORD & INSTITUTIONS
Mortals entered lawful negotiation with the Fey. Institutions replaced fear.

AGE 6 — THE AGE OF QUIET BALANCE
An era of apparent stability. Empires rise and fall within bounds. True Uniques stir. The world is already changing.

⸻

PLAYABLE RACES

HUMANS — THE ADAPTIVE BASELINE

Humans in Talvaren are defined by material realism and lived utility rather than physical extremes.

Their cultures favor locally made goods, visible repair, and practical layering. Variation in body type, age, and presentation is common and unremarkable; strength, obesity, grace, and wear coexist without hierarchy.

Humans thrive in plains and transitional spaces, serving as connectors between regions, professions, and peoples. Authority appears approachable. Labor is visible. Daily life moves forward without ceremony.

Humans are not exceptional by design—but by adaptability, continuity, and presence.

Biome Anchor: Plains
Core Trait: Adaptability through structure

Human societies favor:
	•	contracts
	•	record keeping
	•	scalable institutions

They borrow freely from other cultures, then formalize what works.

⸻ DWARVES — THE CULTURE OF MAKING

Dwarves are unified not by appearance or size, but by craft as identity.

Their societies normalize extreme physical variance—from compact builds to towering, monstrous frames—without spectacle or mythologizing.

Skill defines status more than strength. Mastery is expressed through work rather than ritual.

Dwarven spaces emphasize infrastructure, repetition, and shared labor over symbolism.

Wizards, smiths, tailors, cooks, and laborers emerge naturally from the same cultural spine: precision, patience, and pride in output.

Dwarves do not perform tradition—they operate it.

Biome Anchor: High Mountains
Core Trait: Endurance through continuity

Cooking and provisioning are considered survival skills equal to combat. A dwarf who cannot feed themselves and others is considered unprepared, regardless of strength.

⸻

ELVES — LONGEVITY THROUGH RESTRAINT

Elves live where the land is already ancient. Their settlements grow alongside the forest rather than replacing it.

They value memory, stewardship, and long-term consequence.

Elven society is slow to change and slow to forgive. Loss is remembered longer than victory.

They do not dominate nature; they negotiate with it over generations.

Relationships—both personal and ecological—are considered investments rather than conveniences.

Biome Anchor: Old Forest
Core Trait: Longevity through restraint

⸻ ASHBORN — SURVIVAL THROUGH REBUILDING

Ashborn cultures emerged where destruction is routine and unavoidable.

Storms erase progress regularly, forcing constant reconstruction.

Nothing is built to last forever.
Everything is built to be repaired.

Magic is treated as infrastructure, not mysticism. Practical spellcraft replaces ornamentation.

Ashborn are culturally comfortable with failure. What matters is not avoiding collapse, but how quickly and effectively recovery begins.

Biome Anchor: Stormlands
Core Trait: Survival through rebuilding

Ashborn — Visual Canon v1 (LOCKED)
	•	Base Form: Human-derived humanoids; no horns, tails, tendrils, or non-human appendages
	•	Deformity Rule: Exactly one visible deformity
	•	Deformities are consequences of survival, never decorative, sexualized, or magical
	•	Bodies function normally despite misalignment

ASHBORN — VISUAL CANON v1 (LOCKED)

Base Form
Ashborn are human-derived humanoids.
They have no horns, tails, tendrils, or non-human appendages.
Ashborn read human first, altered second.

⸻

Deformity Rule (Single Slider System)

Each Ashborn has exactly ONE visible deformity.
	•	Deformities are selected via a single cosmetic slider
	•	No stacking
	•	No secondary mutations
	•	No hidden deformities

This rule is absolute.

⸻

Allowed Deformity Types (ONLY)

Ashborn deformities may be chosen from the following list:
	1.	Eye Displacement
	•	Vertical or lateral misalignment
	•	One eye offset relative to the other
	2.	Limb Disparity
	•	One arm or hand smaller, underdeveloped, or shortened
	•	Full functionality retained
	3.	Facial Misplacement
	•	Nose or mouth shifted from central alignment
	•	Expression and speech remain normal
	4.	Cranial Asymmetry
	•	Irregular skull shape
	•	No growths, spikes, or protrusions

⸻

Explicitly Forbidden Deformations

The following are not permitted under any circumstances:
	•	Spine deformation
	•	Rib deformation
	•	Hip deformation
	•	Multiple deformities
	•	Decorative, magical, or sexualized alterations
	•	Monster traits or fantasy exaggeration

⸻

Functional Rule

All Ashborn bodies function normally.
	•	No mechanical penalties or bonuses tied to deformity shape
	•	Deformities are visual consequences, not disabilities
	•	Ashborn are not fragile, cursed, or broken

⸻

Presentation & Tone

Ashborn deformities represent survival, not corruption.
	•	They are the result of catastrophic environments, storms, collapse, and rebuilding
	•	Alterations are practical outcomes, not mystical mutations
	•	Ashborn are survivors who continued living after the world failed them

They are:
	•	Altered, not grotesque
	•	Competent, not pitied
	•	Calm in hostile conditions

⸻

Cultural Read

Ashborn appear as badly reassembled survivors.

Not:
	•	Demons
	•	Experiments
	•	Cursed beings
	•	Victims

But people who endured devastation and adapted.

Allowed Deformity Types:
	•	Eye displacement (vertical or lateral)
	•	Limb disparity (one arm or hand underdeveloped)
	•	Facial misplacement (nose or mouth shifted)
	•	Cranial asymmetry (skull irregularity)

No spine, rib, or hip deformation permitted.

Tone: Ashborn read as badly reassembled survivors—people who endured catastrophic events and continued living.

⸻ THERIANS — SURVIVAL THROUGH MOVEMENT

Therians are nomadic by necessity, not restlessness. The desert punishes stillness.

Their societies emphasize:
	•	route knowledge
	•	resource efficiency
	•	information control

Wealth is circulated, hidden, moved, and reshaped. Jewelers and rogues coexist naturally because both understand misdirection.

Therian culture respects cleverness, adaptability, and shared survival over individual ownership.

Biome Anchor: Desert
Core Trait: Survival through movement

⸻

FEY — IMMORTAL BEINGS OF BEARING

FEY — BEARING SLIDER (VISUAL CANON v1)

Base Form

Fey are immortal humanoids whose appearance reflects how existence, obligation, and memory settle upon them.

They are not humans with pointy ears.
They are not monsters by default.
They are beings whose surface truth changes while their capability does not.

⸻

Bearing System (Three-Point Slider)

All Fey select one Bearing at character creation.

This is a cosmetic-only system.
It never alters mechanics, stats, or abilities.

Bearing determines how a Fey is perceived, not what they can do.

⸻

The Three Bearings

1. Chaotic Bearing (Left)

Raw, untamed, and visibly burdened.
	•	Skin may show roughness, warts, uneven texture, discoloration
	•	Facial structure may include tusks, exaggerated noses, heavy brows
	•	Hair may appear greasy, coarse, or uneven
	•	Overall impression: instinctual, weathered, unpolished

This Bearing reads as troll-like, goblin-adjacent, or primal Fey.

They are not lesser.
They are simply unfiltered.

⸻

2. Puckish Bearing (Center)

Flaws shaped into character.
	•	Features may exaggerate playfully rather than harshly
	•	Tusks curve with intent, brows imply mischief, asymmetry feels deliberate
	•	Imperfections read as charm, humor, or unpredictability
	•	Presence is difficult to judge at a glance

This Bearing represents the Fey most often encountered in stories:
tricksters, bargainers, jesters, and smiling liars.

They are readable — but never fully understood.

⸻

3. Regal Bearing (Right)

Resolved, unburdened, and composed.
	•	Skin appears smooth and clear
	•	Features settle into symmetry and restraint
	•	Presence suggests calm authority, not youth or fragility
	•	May exhibit a subtle clarity or faint luminosity

This is not beauty in the mortal sense.
It is the absence of visible weight.

Regal Fey appear as though nothing presses on them unnecessarily.

⸻

Explicit Limits

The Fey Bearing slider does not allow:
	•	Age regression
	•	Childlike proportions
	•	Sexual exaggeration
	•	Mechanical advantages
	•	Alteration of size, height, mass, or strength

Bearing affects surface expression only.

⸻

Functional Rule

All Fey:
	•	Share identical mechanical capability regardless of Bearing
	•	Speak, move, fight, and cast normally
	•	Are not corrected, fixed, or normalized by the system

A Chaotic Fey and a Regal Fey are equally competent.

The world reacts to how they appear — not what they are.

⸻

Cultural Framing (Player-Facing Truth)

Fey believe Bearing reflects how one has moved through obligation.

It is shaped by:
	•	Promises kept or broken
	•	Time spent bound or unbound
	•	Whether one resisted the Courts — or carried them willingly

Bearing is not judgment.
It is residue.

Fey are immortal beings shaped by obligation, promise, and consequence.

Over time, these forces leave marks—not on the soul, but on the surface.

This expression is known as Bearing.

Bearing does not change what a Fey can do.
It changes how they are seen.

There are three recognized Bearings:

Chaotic Bearing  
Raw and untamed. Marks, asymmetry, and roughness left unpolished.

Puckish Bearing  
Flaws become character rather than burden. Mischief, exaggeration, unreadable intent.

Regal Bearing  
Refined and resolved. Presence settles into quiet authority.

Bearing is chosen at creation and cannot be altered.

⸻

DEEP DELVERS — SURVIVAL THROUGH PROCEDURE

Deep Delvers are pale, hairless, extremely slender humanoids with solid black eyes adapted for true darkvision.

They exist because the underground cannot function without order.

Routes are logged.
Hazards are categorized.
Claims are witnessed and archived.
Sentences are recorded and carried.

Bureaucracy is memory made usable.

Deep Delvers act as legal and logistical intermediaries between surface civilizations and the depths.

They are not liked.
They are relied upon.

Biome Anchor: Lower Mountains / Vast Below Access
Core Trait: Survival through procedure

⸻ THERIAN — RACIAL CANON (FORMALIZED)

Patch Notice (Immediate & Retroactive)
All references to Gnoll throughout Talvaren documentation, systems, dialogue, and internal notes are hereby replaced with Therian.

Gnoll lore, mechanics, and cultural references are now Therian lore.

“Gnoll” is deprecated terminology and should no longer appear in player-facing or dev-facing material.

⸻

THERIANS — SURVIVAL THROUGH MOVEMENT

Therians are humanoid beings with animal-adjacent traits, shaped by environment, trade, and constant relocation rather than territorial dominance.

They are not monsters.
They are not caricatures.
They are people whose physiology reflects adaptability rather than predation.

Therian societies emerged in regions where stillness is punished — deserts, transitional trade corridors, and hazard-prone routes where knowledge of movement is more valuable than ownership of land.

They travel not because they wander, but because remaining in one place too long is inefficient.

⸻

BIOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK

Base Form
	•	Upright humanoid posture
	•	Two arms, two legs
	•	Human-compatible skeletal structure
	•	Full tool use and equipment compatibility
	•	No nonstandard movement requirements
	•	Fully Unity-engine compatible

Therians are animal-adjacent, not animal-dominant.

⸻

Primary Species Basis (LOCKED — v1)

For engine stability and visual cohesion, Therian characters use a single base animal species:

Canine (Dog-Derived)

This includes visual inspiration from:
	•	shepherd-type dogs
	•	desert canids
	•	fox-adjacent facial structure (stylized, restrained)

This choice:
	•	minimizes rigging complexity
	•	preserves realism
	•	allows future cosmetic expansion without core rework

⸻

THERIAN SLIDER SYSTEM (SINGLE SLIDER — LOCKED)

Therians use one cosmetic slider only.

Animal Expression Slider

Controls the degree of visible animal traits.

Left (Low Expression)
	•	Mostly human facial structure
	•	Subtle nose and eye shape variance
	•	Minimal facial fur
	•	Reads “human first”

Center (Balanced)
	•	Clearly Therian
	•	Animal-like facial geometry
	•	Moderate facial fur
	•	Fully integrated appearance

Right (High Expression)
	•	Strong animal facial traits
	•	Pronounced muzzle
	•	Dense facial fur
	•	Still humanoid in posture and movement

⸻

Explicit Constraints (Absolute)
	•	No change to:
	•	hitbox
	•	animation set
	•	movement speed
	•	combat reach
	•	Cosmetic only
	•	No stat impact
	•	No mechanical advantages or penalties

⸻

JUVENILE TRANSITION (IMPLIED BIOLOGY — MINIMAL CANON)

Therians experience a non-ritualized, non-celebrated biological transition during adolescence.

Visual Indicators (Possible, Not Guaranteed)
	•	Patchy facial fur
	•	Hair growth on nose and inner ear
	•	Uneven fur density
	•	Acne and skin irritation

This phase:
	•	is biological, not cultural
	•	has no rites, rules, or social laws attached
	•	is not mechanically tracked
	•	is not enforced by the system

It exists only to support visual realism and variation.

⸻

TAILS & EXTENDED FEATURES
	•	Tails are NOT part of the base Therian model
	•	Tails are cosmetic-only options
	•	May be added later as purchasable or unlockable cosmetics
	•	Absence of a tail is considered normal

No tail-based mechanics exist.

⸻

CULTURE & SOCIETY

Therian culture emphasizes:
	•	route knowledge
	•	trade efficiency
	•	information circulation
	•	shared survival over personal hoarding

Wealth is:
	•	portable
	•	flexible
	•	often converted into tools, reagents, or favors

Therians naturally gravitate toward:
	•	traders
	•	alchemists
	•	scribes
	•	expedition professionals
	•	logistics and scouting roles

They are not inherently stealthy, savage, or aggressive.

They are practical.

⸻

BIOME ANCHOR

Desert / Transitional Regions

⸻

CORE TRAIT (LORE)

Survival through movement

⸻

RACIAL ADVANTAGE / DISADVANTAGE (MECHANICAL — STORED)

Advantage — Shrewd Traders
	•	−5% vendor prices

Disadvantage — Nomadic Focus
	•	−5% maximum mana

(No changes from prior Therian values; terminology updated only.)

⸻ 🧟 UNDEAD — PLAYER CREATION (LOCKED)

Undead characters use the standard humanoid skeleton and animation set.
All Undead differences are cosmetic-only and low CPU, implemented via material and decal layers.

No mechanical changes to movement, combat, or interaction.

⸻

🧟 UNDEAD — FLAVOR TEXT (PLAYER-FACING)

(Lore Bible Ready)

⸻

UNDEAD — THOSE WHO CONTINUED

Undead are not monsters.

They are people whose lives did not end when death arrived.

During the Age of the Living Dead, death itself was altered. When the purges ended, not all Undead were destroyed. Some endured. Some were stabilized. Some were permitted to remain.

Undeath did not break death.
It damaged it.

Undead do not bleed.
They do not breathe.
They do not tire in the way the living do.

They still work.
They still love.
They still build lives.

⸻

Cultural Perception

Undead are treated as a population, not a condition.

They are:
	•	accounted for
	•	regulated
	•	taxed
	•	buried differently

Most societies have learned that Undead are safer inside institutions than outside them.

Fear did not disappear.
It was replaced with procedure.

⸻ NON-PLAYER RACES

KOBOLDS — RACIAL FOUNDATION

Kobolds have no homeland.

They exist everywhere that does not enforce a kill-on-sight rule.

They live in spare rooms, service corridors, unused buildings, half-forgotten infrastructure, and anywhere tolerance exists.

Kobolds are generous, caring, and deeply social. They form strong bonds quickly and defend those bonds with absolute ferocity.

Kobolds do not steal.
They do not borrow.
They do not negotiate with fools.

Care equals use. An unused item is a neglected item.

Ownership is respected.
Neglect is not.

Examples considered heirlooms:
	•	Slippers with a hole worn into them
	•	A single good knife (“The Good Dagger”)
	•	A softly glowing pendant that whispers of a buried hoard

Kobolds are guests who never ask permission—and are deeply offended if told they are not welcome.

⸻

WORLD PHILOSOPHY

A body is not a verdict.

People come in many shapes, many weights, many ages, and many states of wear.

There is no “correct” body here.

The world responds to what you do, not how closely you resemble an imagined ideal.

Talvaren is dangerous, ancient, and demanding.
But it does not mock its people.

You are allowed to exist here as you are.

⸻

WORLD FEEL & ENVIRONMENTAL LOGIC

World events are unannounced.

They manifest through patrol migrations,l, beast drift, lightning surges, weather, and seasonal hazards.

Change occurs silently.

There are no patch notes for reality.

Safe Zones are not invulnerability fields.
They are permissions.

Light is never free.

⸻ SIZE & PHYSICALITY — FLAVOR

Size, race, and physicality matter.

Beings are not scaled humans; they experience the world differently, socially and materially.

Talvaren enforces boundaries through systems, not morality.

Literacy is not assumed.

DEV-FACING LORE

SECTION II — DEV FACING LORE

(Authorial truth — not known to the world)

⸻

ON DEV-FACING INFORMATION

Information under this heading is not a contradiction.

It represents authorial truth that differs from what the world believes.
Player-facing lore is believed to be accurate by the world and is treated as such.

Truth may be discovered through rumor, contradiction, focused investigation, and long-term play, but is never confirmed outright.

⸻

THE TRUE AGES

There exists a Forbidden First Age erased from all mortal record.

The world is not in the Sixth Age.

The world is in the True Seventh Age.

Only three surviving dragons and The Fox know the timeline is miscounted.

The following are true but unknown to mortals:
	•	The First Age existed
	•	The Age count is incorrect
	•	The world has already advanced beyond what it believes

⸻ THE AGE OF PROMISE (DEV CONTEXT)

References to the “Age of Promise” are prophetic, not ordinal.

It is not an Eighth Age in sequence.

Associated (but not inevitable) events include:
	•	The return of the Nullbrand Revenant
	•	The destruction of Vallinoraxistup
	•	The sacrifice of Queen Mab

None are guaranteed.
None are preventable.

⸻

VALLINORAXISTUP — SCOPE CLARIFICATION

Vallinoraxistup’s judgment was absolute only in two historical events:
	•	The eradication of the majority of the Arachni
	•	The suppression and binding of the Deep Delvers

Vallinoraxistup is not a permanent cosmic judge.

His authority persists because escalation once existed, not because judgment is ongoing.

Charters, precedent, and subterranean order were shaped by his intervention, not continuously enforced by his presence.

⸻ FEY BEARING — DESIGN TRUTH

Bearing is cosmetic only.

It reflects accumulated obligation, promise, and consequence over time.

Bearing does not:
	•	alter stats
	•	alter capability
	•	alter voice, movement, or role

It exists for:
	•	player expression
	•	world reaction
	•	narrative consistency

⸻

THE FOX — AUTHORIAL TRUTH

The Fox is killable.

If The Fox dies, he will return.

No one—including The Fox—knows why.

The Fox sells cosmetic and flavor items only.

His continued existence is a narrative constant, not a mechanical loophole.

⸻

DEEP DELVERS — INTERNAL TRUTH

Deep Delver authority derives from precedent and fear of escalation, not worship or divine mandate.

They do not serve Vallinoraxistup.

They operate knowing that escalation once existed—and could again.

OTHER / FLAVOR / ARCHIVE

SECTION III — OTHER / FLAVOR ARCHIVE

(Narrative, tone, dialogue, atmosphere, and reference material)

⸻

SIZE & PHYSICALITY — FLAVOR

Size, race, and physicality matter.

Beings are not scaled humans; they experience the world differently, socially and materially.

Talvaren enforces boundaries through systems, not morality.

Literacy is not assumed.

⸻

TINY — FLAVOR (CANONICAL)

Size, leverage, and precision matter.

Tiny beings are not weakened forms of larger races; they are adapted to a world that rewards efficiency, awareness, and control.

They navigate spaces others overlook, rely on timing over force, and trade raw impact for intent.

Physical limitations are real, but so are the advantages of subtlety, reach, and survivability.

Power is expressed through placement, not mass.

Talvaren does not “fix” smallness.
It models it.

⸻

MONSTROUS — FLAVOR

Monstrous beings are not scaled humans.

Their size, race, and physicality change how they are perceived and how they interact with the world.

⸻ EXERTION — WORLD EXPLANATION

“A mage does not tire in the legs first. They tire in the mind.”

In Talvaren, all action is exertion.

Steel taxes the body.
Magic taxes the will.

Running, casting, fighting — all draw from the same truth:

You cannot act without cost.

A warrior loses breath.
A rogue loses focus.
A mage loses coherence.

Those who sprint thoughtlessly arrive faster —
and arrive spent.

⸻

CASTING & MOVEMENT — IN-WORLD FRAMING

“Running while holding a spell together is harder than standing still.”

“You can move, or you can focus. Those who master both earn it.”

Instant spells are not faster spells —
they are spells that no longer require attention.

⸻

RESOURCE SCARCITY — WORLD TONE

“Power isn’t gone. You just spent it.”

“If it came back on its own, it wouldn’t be worth carrying.”

“Preparation is cheaper than panic.”

⸻ WORLD FEEL & ENVIRONMENTAL LOGIC

World events are unannounced.

They manifest through patrol migrations, beast drift, lightning surges, weather, and seasonal hazards.

Change occurs silently.

There are no patch notes for reality.

⸻

FIELD KIT — CANONICAL FLAVOR TEXT

A battered collection of essentials gathered from a lifetime on the road.

Rope. Chalk. A monocle that definitely isn’t yours.
A mining pick, a needle, a pan, a quill — and somehow never the one thing you actually need.

⸻

UNIFIED VENDOR ITEM FLAVOR TEXT — LOCKED

⸻ NPC DIALOGUE & VOICE POOLS

CARAVAN / BUREAUCRATIC NPC LINES

“You should’ve thought ahead.”
“No, you can’t just hop on. That’s why there are forms.”
“No forms, no passage. That’s how this works.”
“You want the other road? That post’s a mile back.”

⸻

ARTIFACT SPECIALIST — DIALOGUE

Payment Taken:
	•	“Oh-ho! This will do nicely.”
	•	“Don’t mind if I do — I’ve always wanted one of these!”
	•	“Aaaand… my fee. You won’t be needing that, surely!”
	•	“Excellent! A fine specimen. Payment accepted.”
	•	“A curious trinket… I’ll take it off your hands.”
	•	“Yes, yes, yes… this one is MINE now.”
	•	“A fair price, wouldn’t you say? Too late if not!”
	•	“Wonderful! My collection grows again.”
	•	“You brought four? You’re generous! I only need one…”
	•	“Let me just… yoink. That one belongs to me now.”

After Identification:
	•	“All right, let’s see what secrets these baubles hold.”
	•	“Aha! Very interesting… here is what you actually have.”
	•	“You’ve been carrying THIS around? Fascinating.”
	•	“Revealed! Try not to faint.”
	•	“All done. Do try not to break them before selling.”

⸻

IDENTIFIER NPC — PERSONALITY SAMPLE

Marwa, the Bog Lantern — Marshlands
Cruel humor. Refuses clean objects.

“If it ain’t makin’ a noise or drippin’, it ain’t worth lookin’ at.”

⸻ SCROLLS, WRITS & BUREAUCRACY — FLAVOR

“Yes, this was created by a bureaucrat.
No, you can’t cut in line.”

“If wizards could think a spell, there would be no more wizards over the age of five.”

“This document certifies that the attached spell was cast properly, lawfully, and without incident. Any attempt to reproduce said spell without authorization will be met with fines, audits, or worse… you get to wait in line at the House of Authority for peer review.”

⸻

ATMOSPHERIC & WORLD TONE TEXT

Through careful pressure and practiced restraint, the Jeweler reduces excess crystal to its purest workable form. What is lost in mass is gained in precision.

Capitals favor specific cultures. Treasure complements the crafting economy. Every dangerous expedition yields at least one meaningful reward.

Aggro in Talvaren is biological, not numeric. Noise, movement, visibility, and threat define targeting.

Safe Zones are permissions.

Only specific professions create infinite safe zones. Others provide ambient warmth or light.

Light is a tactical and exploration resource.
Light is never free.

⸻ RUMORS, CONTRADICTIONS & CHARACTER — THE FOX

NPCs contradict each other constantly — and that’s exactly how he likes it.

“He once convinced a duke to buy his own castle back.”
“He smuggles dragon eggs.”
“He knows when artifacts will surface before the earth does.”
“He owns half the Shadow Consortium.”
“He is the Shadow Consortium.”
“He is banned from twelve nations but still visits them weekly.”
“He has no magical power — just a dangerous mind.”
“He’s older than he looks.”
“He’s younger than he looks.”
“He can talk his way out of death.”

⸻

SIGNATURE QUOTES

“If you think I’m harmless, congratulations — you’re already losing.”
“People don’t fear the truth. They fear finding out they were wrong.”
“History is a story told by survivors. I prefer the version told by witnesses.”
“The Eighth Age? Oh, darling… that’s centuries away.”
“I never lie. I simply… curate the truth.”
“Kings rule nations. I rule kings.”
“Dragons forget. I don’t have that luxury.”

⸻

WORLD & ECOSYSTEM FEEL

Fauna are passive unless provoked.
Apex predators are critical to ecosystem balance.
Fodder creatures shift locations to maintain population pressure.
Dangerous regions naturally produce better rewards.

⸻

THE VAST BELOW — FLAVOR

Multiple underground layers with decreasing safety.
Rare sightlines to the surface from upper reaches.
Verticality conveyed through sound and visual cues.
Few tunnels connect layers to preserve danger and mystery.

⸻ WORLD EVENTS — EMERGENT FEEL

Patrol migrations reshape encounters.
Fey activity alters zones subtly.

No announcements.
Players discover changes organically.

⸻

PLAYER PHILOSOPHY — FLAVOR

Exploration and observation are rewarded.
Progression is never forced.
The world reacts but does not explain itself.
Danger is respected, not trivialized.

Professional identity is preserved without forcing combat or crafting supremacy.

Professional identity is preserved
without forcing combat or crafting supremacy.

Choice creates diversity without homogenization.

⸻

⸻

SECTION 2 — PLAYER RESOURCES

Primary Resources
	•	Health (HP) is not a spendable resource
	•	Mana and Stamina are the only spendable resources
	•	A character’s Primary Class determines which resource all abilities use
	•	Movement actions may consume the primary resource

Primary Resource Law
	•	HP is a life resource only
	•	No ability ever costs HP
	•	HP loss occurs only through damage or world consequences

There are:
	•	No mixed-cost abilities
	•	No dual-resource abilities
	•	No exceptions

⸻

SECTION 3 — RESOURCE BAR STRUCTURE

Each spendable resource uses a Two-Bar System:
	•	Active Resource Bar
	•	Reserve Resource Bar (33% of maximum)

Rules:
	•	Resource expenditure draws from Reserve first
	•	No passive regeneration of Active or Reserve Bars
	•	Magical healing cannot restore the Reserve Bar

Reserve refills only via:
	•	Consumables
	•	Safe Zones

When Reserve is empty → Cracked State
	•	Cracked resources cannot refill until Safe Zone access or consumable use

⸻

SECTION 4 — RESOURCE REGENERATION RULES

Primary Resource Regeneration

Primary resources (Mana, Stamina) do not regenerate naturally.

There is:
	•	No passive regeneration
	•	No out-of-combat regeneration
	•	No stat-based regeneration
	•	No class-based regeneration

Resources are restored only via:
	•	Consumables

Status: ACTIVE — Unlocked for evaluation

Reserve Bar Regeneration

Status: OPEN DESIGN NOTE
	•	A very slow Reserve regeneration may be allowed in the future
	•	Not decided
	•	Not implemented
	•	Not implied

If allowed:
	•	Would be extremely slow
	•	Would never replace consumables

	•	Any Cast Time greater than 0 requires stationary casting
	•	Cast time reduction cannot reduce below 0
	•	Instant cast status is binary (no partial movement)

Status: STRUCTURAL — Pending Final Reconfirmation

⸻

SECTION 6 — UNIVERSAL BUFF RULES
	•	Weak Buff → +15%
	•	Strong Buff → +45%

Rules:
	•	Buffs are category-based
	•	Buffs of the same category do not stack
	•	Reapplying a buff refreshes duration only
	•	Weak never upgrades to Strong
	•	Strong never downgrades to Weak

⸻

SECTION 7 — DAMAGE SYSTEMS

Mechanical Damage Types

Talvaren uses exactly four (4) mechanical damage types:
	•	Physical
	•	Magic
	•	Arcane
	•	Mental

All Mandala / elemental terms (Light, Fire, Ice, etc.) are flavor only and have no mechanical damage, resistance, or weakness math.

Damage Magnitude Placeholders

Each mechanical damage type uses four magnitude tiers:
	•	Weak
	•	Standard
	•	Strong
	•	Major

Rules:
	•	These are relative tiers, not numbers
	•	Numeric tuning is deferred to tables
	•	No stacking magnitude math
	•	No sub-tiers
	•	Same magnitude = same budget everywhere

Mental Damage Special Rule

Mental damage is effect-first, not damage-first.
	•	Deals minimal or zero HP damage
	•	Magnitudes define duration and severity, not damage

Tier meaning:
	•	Weak → very short, minor disruption
	•	Standard → short, meaningful disruption
	•	Strong → long, high-impact disruption
	•	Major → very long or encounter-defining effect

Mental effects still obey:
	•	No immunity rules
	•	CC-break rules
	•	Refresh-not-stack rules

⸻

SECTION 8 — SPRINT & MOVEMENT AUTHORITY
	•	Sprint available at Level 1
	•	Sprint is an exertive action
	•	Sprint drains Active Stamina
	•	Sprint may drain Reserve
	•	Sprint never restores resources
	•	Sprint disabled if Stamina is Cracked
	•	Walking and normal movement remain free
	•	Encumbrance modifies stamina efficiency

No other module may redefine sprint behavior.

Status: STRUCTURAL — Pending Stress Testing

⸻

SECTION 9 — DUAL-CLASS RULES
	•	Maximum of two classes per character

Primary Class:
	•	Defines resource type
	•	Defines scaling model

Secondary Class:
	•	Grants abilities only

All abilities use the Primary Resource.

⸻

PRIMARY RESOURCE HD GROWTH COEFFICIENTS (PER CLASS)

Definition
Each class has three HD values: HP / Mana / Stamina.
Total HD per class is always 40.
HD is determined at character creation, permanent, and retroactive.

Classes scale to player-selected height.
Classes are not size-locked.

⸻

LEVEL-1 STAT FRAMEWORK (GLOBAL)

Six primary stats: STR, CON, DEX, INT, WIS, ART.

All Level-1 limits are creation-only constraints and do not cap long-term growth.

Players receive 20 free stat points at Level 1.
All stat points must be allocated at creation.

⸻

LEVEL-1 STAT FRAMEWORK — STANDARD SIZE

Baseline:
All stats start at 8.

Maximums:
No stat may exceed 15 at Level 1.

⸻

LEVEL-1 STAT FRAMEWORK — TINY SIZE

Minimum stats:
STR 4
CON 4

ART 8

Maximum stats:
STR 16
CON 16

STR and CON maximums are intentional traps.

SECTION 11 — CORE STATS & PROGRESSION

Primary Stats

STR, CON, DEX, INT, WIS, ART are the six primary player stats.
	•	A stat value of 8 represents the world average and confers no bonus or penalty
	•	Values above 8 confer advantages
	•	Values below 8 impose penalties
	•	There are no stat caps
	•	Stats may increase indefinitely over a character’s lifetime

Level 1 Stat Allocation
	•	Players receive 20 stat points
	•	Beginning stats depend on size
	•	Size-based min/max apply (Level 1 only)

Post-Level-1 Stat Allocation
	•	+2 stat points per level
	•	All stat points must be spent immediately
	•	Each allocation event limited to +1 per stat

Loot-granted stat points:
	•	Bypass level-based limits
	•	Still obey the +1 per stat per allocation rule

Attribute effects are per-point, not per-level.
Stat bonuses apply retroactively to all levels, including Level 1.

⸻

SECTION 12 — LITERACY & UI GATES
	•	INT ≤ 10 → Cannot read
	•	INT ≥ 11 → Literacy enabled
	•	WIS < 11 → Compass disabled
	•	Symbol-based signage still functions

Size does not hard-block literacy or compass access, but size-based stat pressure may discourage reaching thresholds early.

⸻

SECTION 13 — PRIMARY RESOURCES & HD

Primary resources are:
	•	HP
	•	Mana
	•	Stamina

Each primary resource is governed by a class-defined HD growth coefficient.

HD is:
	•	Determined at character creation
	•	Permanent once play begins
	•	A growth coefficient, not a temporary modifier

Starting resource at Level 1:
	•	HD × 10
	•	Then modified by player stat allocation

At every level after Level 1:
	•	Resource maximum increases by +HD

Stat-based modifiers apply retroactively, including Level 1.

⸻

SECTION 14 — ATTRIBUTE EFFECTS (PER POINT)
	•	STR → Stamina Max
	•	WIS → Mana Max
	•	ART → Stamina efficiency + Stamina Max
	•	CON → HP per point (retroactive)
	•	DEX → Physical mitigation
	•	INT → Spell interaction logic

⸻

SECTION 15 — NUMERIC STAT MECHANICS

Strength (STR)

STR governs physical damage, stamina growth, and carry capacity.

Damage
	•	STR 4: −2 damage per attack
	•	STR 6: −1 damage per attack
	•	STR 8: no modifier
	•	STR 10: +1 damage
	•	Every +2 STR above 10: +1 damage
	•	No cap

Stamina per Level (HD-gated, retroactive)
	•	STR 4: −2 stamina per level
	•	STR 6: −1 stamina per level
	•	STR 8: no modifier
	•	STR 10: +1 stamina per level
	•	Every +2 STR above 10: +1 stamina per level

Carry Capacity
	•	+2 kg per STR point

STR damage applies to all player physical attacks.
World or mob traps are exempt from STR rules.

Constitution (CON)

CON follows the same numeric scaling pattern as STR but applies to HP per level.

Wisdom (WIS)

WIS follows the same numeric scaling pattern as STR but applies to Mana per level.

Dexterity (DEX)

DEX governs movement speed, incoming melee damage taken, and dual wielding.

Movement Speed
	•	DEX 4: −5%
	•	DEX 6: −2.5%
	•	DEX 8: no modifier
	•	DEX 10: +3%
	•	Every +3 DEX above 10: +3%

Incoming Melee Damage Taken
	•	DEX 4: +5%
	•	DEX 6: +2.5%
	•	DEX 8: no modifier

Dual Wielding
	•	At DEX 11, the player may dual wield an off-hand weapon weighing 2 kg or less
	•	Off-hand attacks apply to auto attacks only, not abilities
	•	Off-hand attack speed at DEX 11 is 1 attack every 3 seconds
	•	Each DEX above 11 reduces off-hand attack interval by 0.1 seconds
	•	Off-hand attack speed is hard-capped by the primary-hand weapon’s maximum attack speed

No skills, gear, buffs, or systems other than DEX may ever modify off-hand attack speed.

⸻

SECTION 16 — SAFE ZONES
	•	Allow recovery and logistical action
	•	Do not prevent consequences

Aggro rules:
	•	A mob pulled into a Safe Zone remains aggroed only to:

⸻

SECTION 17 — SCROLLS & WRITS

Scrolls
	•	Spell-adjacent, single-use items
	•	Instant cast

  <h2>Module 1B — Equipment & Gear Systems</h2>
  MODULE-1B —Equipment & Gear Systems

📜 MODULE 1B — EQUIPMENT & GEAR SYSTEMS (CANON)

Status: Active Canon Module
Companion Module: Module 1A — Player Core Systems

⸻

MODULE-1B — EQUIPMENT & GEAR SYSTEMS (SCOPE)

• Equipment Weight System
• Weapon and armor behavior governed exclusively by weight class
• No damage-type math, mitigation curves, or stat scaling exists in equipment
• Weight determines stamina friction, encumbrance expectations, and interaction limits
• No armor “types” (plate/leather/etc.) exist in the engine
• All meshes must conform to defined weight envelopes

• Equipment Slot Framework (priority clause)

Primary gear slots:
• Head
• Chest
• Legs
• Boots
• Shoulders / Back (shared)
• Arms
• Belt
• Main Hand
• Off-Hand (Shield or Light Weapon)
• Ranged

Jewelry slots:
• Ring ×4
• Neck

• Jewelry Rules
• 4 rings + 1 necklace
• Jewelry never scales with tier, rarity, enchantment, or effect
• Jewelry never meaningfully affects encumbrance
• Jewelry never grants combat-defining bonuses

• Slot Identities & Bonus Locks
• Each equipment slot has exclusive allowed bonus categories
• Slot-identity bonuses never roll randomly
• Primary stats are belt-exclusive
• Healing and magic amplification bonuses restricted by slot
• No profession bonuses may appear on equipment

• Stamina & Auto-Attack Interaction
• Ability stamina cost modified by weapon weight
• Auto-attacks:
• cost 0 stamina
• animation-timed
• fixed swing times
• no per-frame stamina math

• Weapon & Armor Category Profiles
• Light / Medium / Heavy categories are permanent, global, uniform
• Cannot be overridden without explicit patch

• Artifact Item Categories (equipment context)
• Artifacts are:
• non-equippable
• non-functional
• display-only
• economy-safe
• Never grant stats, slots, affixes

• Equipment ↔ Player Boundary
• Equipment defines mass and friction only
• Player thresholds, sprint logic, stamina regen rules, reserves, cracked state = Module 1A

• Tools & World Interaction
• Field Kit: no weight, no stats, no combat use
• Professional tools abstracted into Field Kit
• Weapons may level; armor never levels
• No future system may require tool-equipping unless patched

• Mount Acquisition & Authority
• Tamer is the only class with persistent mounts
• Paladin mounts are conjured and exempt
• All tamer mounts are killable; death is permanent
• Mounted combat does not exist
• Dismounted mounts travel to nearest stables
• All tames share a global cooldown

• Caravan Ox — Command Rules
• Commands may be issued while the Ox is dismounted
• Commands affect only the Ox owned by the issuing Tamer
• “Go Home” sends the Ox to the nearest valid stables
• While active, the Ox serves as a mobile stable anchor for the owner’s party

⸻

PURPOSE

Centralize all mechanical rules for:
• Weapons
• Armor
• Equipment slots
• Weight rules
• Stamina interaction
• Slot identities
• Affix and secondary bonus restrictions
• Artifact item categories
• Equipment–world interaction boundaries
• Mount acquisition, taming tiers, and advanced travel authority

⸻

LEGAL / INTEGRATION NOTES
	1.	Module 1B defines all equipment-based systems, including:
• Weapons
• Armor
• Equipment slots
• Weight rules
• Stamina interaction
• Affix and secondary bonus restrictions
• Artifact item categories
• Equipment–world interaction boundaries
	2.	Module 1A governs all player-side physics (stats, stamina pools, sprint logic, encumbrance thresholds, dual-class fundamentals).
	3.	When an interaction concerns both player physics and equipment stats:
• Module 1A takes priority unless Module 1B explicitly overrides for gear-specific logic.
	4.	Locked sections of Module 1B override all other modules unless explicitly patched.
	5.	Additive sections do not override locked canon unless stated.
	6.	Module 6 governs Field Kit mechanics; Module 1B governs how they interact with equipment systems.

  <h2>Module 4 — World Geography & Biomes</h2>
  MODULE 4 — World Geography & Biomes

(AUTHORITATIVE SUPPORTING RECORD — NON-GAMEPLAY)

Purpose

Identify all assumptions, dependencies, exclusions, and “silent rules” that affect Module 4 — World Geography & Biomes, but are defined elsewhere.

This document:
	•	Introduces no mechanics
	•	Defines no systems
	•	Exists to prevent accidental rule injection, duplication, or contradiction

⸻

1. GLOBAL RULE DEPENDENCIES (ASSUMED, NOT DEFINED HERE)

Module 4 assumes the following global laws exist without redefining them.

1.1 Caravan Route Immutability
	•	Caravan routes:
	•	Are never delayed, damaged, destroyed, or blocked
	•	Dynamically route around hazards
	•	Module 4 relies on caravan rhythm and compatibility
	•	The immutability rule lives in global travel canon
	•	❗ If omitted elsewhere, travel logic breaks

⸻

1.2 No PvP Rule
	•	Module 4 geography, safe zones, and camps assume:
	•	Zero PvP
	•	No territorial grief mechanics
	•	This rule is not declared in Module 4
	•	It lives in global combat law

⸻

1.3 Player Death & Resurrection Rules
	•	Module 4 defines environmental hazards (e.g., polar cold)
	•	It does not define:
	•	Death consequences
	•	Resurrection timing
	•	Corpse recovery
	•	Assumes Adventurer’s Guild systems elsewhere

⸻

2. SYSTEMS INTENTIONALLY EXCLUDED FROM MODULE 4

	•	Underground black market access references True Uniques
	•	Utilization / neglect timer (10-day rule) is not here
	•	Lives in global item governance
	•	Module 4 references access only, not enforcement

⸻

2.2 Structural World State System
	•	Bridges, towers, roads degrading over time:
	•	Not defined here

  MODULE 7 — Non-Magic Abilities & Skills

(Structural rules only; no class-specific lists yet)

ABILITY PROGRESSION — GLOBAL RULES
	•	Each class has up to 48 total abilities by Level 61.
	•	Ability totals and grant pacing are defined in Module 6.
	•	Abilities are intentionally divisible by 8, reinforcing Talvaren’s core cosmology.
	•	Ability categories are universal:
	•	Spells
	•	Activated Abilities
	•	Skills
	•	Passives
	•	Players may hotbar as many abilities as they want.
	•	The system does not protect players from complexity; choice is celebrated.

⸻

DESTINATION: Module 7 — Non-Magic Abilities & Skills

CORE ROTATION RULE (KISS — HARD)

Each class has exactly 4 core rotational actions:
	1.	1 Basic action (always usable)
	2.	2 Setup / Builder actions
	3.	1 Maintenance action

Rules:
	•	No secondary resource systems exist.
	•	No rage bars, fury meters, elemental buildup, counters, or stacks.
	•	Only primary resources exist (stamina, mana, health).
	•	Core rotation is intentionally simple; depth comes from situational and optional abilities.

⸻

NO RETROACTIVE ACCESS RULE — ADVENTURERS
	•	Dual-classing never grants access to levels 1–10 abilities of the second class.
	•	Example:
	•	A Level 10 Rogue who dual-classes into Warrior:
	•	Keeps Rogue 1–10 abilities
	•	Gains Warrior abilities only from levels 11–60
	•	A Warrior who started as Warrior has access to Warrior abilities from levels 1–60.
	•	These characters are intentionally asymmetric.

	•	Humanoids: aggressive; drop coins, weapons, gear, rare profession resources.
	•	Apex / Lieutenants: high-difficulty, unique drops, long respawns.
	•	Boss / Apex / Lieutenant Rule References
	•	Bosses: scripted Apex encounters; multi-phase; short CC only; environmental mechanics; drops include high-tier crafting materials and Mandala reagents.
	•	Lieutenants: persistent route patrol threats; death temporarily weakens patrols; respawn via world pressure logic.
	•	Chaos-Touched: random corruption of Common/Elite only; gains 1 mechanic, stat delta, behavior mutation; visual corruption; used to break farming patterns.
	•	Vast Below Enemy Structure (behavioral tier relation)
	•	VB Common = Surface Elite.
	•	VB Elite = Surface Mini-Boss.
	•	VB Apex = world-altering threat.
	•	Overfarming increases patrols, elite spawn, Chaos-Touched probability.

  <h2>Module 12 — Progression, XP & Caps</h2>
  ✅ MODULE 12 — Progression, XP & Caps (CORRECTED)

Ability Grant Milestones — FINALIZED (AUTHORITATIVE VIA MODULE 6)
	•	Ability grants occur at Effective Levels:
	•	Level 11
	•	Level 21
	•	Level 31
	•	Level 41
	•	Level 51
	•	Level 61
	•	Level 61 abilities are:
	•	Intentionally high-impact
	•	Identity-defining
	•	Not numerical scaling rewards

Ability totals, per-level grants, and caps are defined in Module 6 and referenced here for progression context only.

This replaces the earlier 11/22/33/44/55 pattern.

⸻

Dual-Class On-Ramp Clarification
	•	Secondary class always enters at the next Effective Level
	•	This intentionally skips Level 1 of the secondary class
	•	This ensures dual-class characters:
	•	Are never ability-starved
	•	Immediately gain access to new class tools

Fully consistent and aligned with Module 6 effective-level math.

⸻

Progression Structure (world scale)
	•	Zone clusters span 20–25 levels
	•	Distribution rule:
	•	1× level 60 → 3× level 50 zones
	•	1× level 50 → 3× level 40 zones
	•	Entire game playable via underground alone
	•	Ocean progression is lateral only
	•	No endgame region exists
	•	Polar continents exceed standard world cap

⸻

Reward Law (progression link)
	•	Permanent one-time biome stat gain encounters exist (see Module 4)
	•	Zone-relative danger scaling (not player-level based)

⸻

Vendor crafting limit (scope note)
	•	Profession vendors sell Common-grade basic resources only
	•	Inventory limited strictly to Module 13 registry
	•	Laborer and Tamer vendors sell none

⸻

LEVEL PROGRESSION — GLOBAL RULES
	•	Maximum level: 61
	•	No PvP exists in Talvaren. Ever.
	•	Difficulty, tension, and mastery come exclusively from the world and its systems
	•	Player choice is prioritized over optimization enforcement

⸻

ABILITY UNLOCK TIMING — HARD (REFERENCE ONLY)
	•	Ability pacing, totals, and caps are defined in Module 6
	•	This module governs when choices occur, not how many abilities exist

Any numeric ability counts listed below are contextual milestones and must not override Module 6.

⸻

PRIMARY CLASS RULE — ADVENTURERS
	•	A player’s first class choice is permanent and is their Primary Class
	•	Primary Class defines identity and early training forever

By Level 10:
	•	Adventurers receive 8 class-defining abilities from their Primary Class
	•	These form the irreversible core of the character

⸻

LEVEL 10 HARD CHOICE — ADVENTURERS

At Level 10, Adventurers face a mandatory, blocking choice:
	•	The choice window does not expire
	•	Progression halts until a decision is made
	•	Combat state does not bypass the choice

Choices:
	1.	Continue leveling the Primary Class
	2.	Dual-class into any other available class

⸻

DUAL-CLASSING RULES — ADVENTURERS (HARD)
	•	Dual-classing occurs in fixed 10-level blocks
	•	Players are locked into their class choice for the next 10 levels
	•	At the end of each 10-level block, the player chooses again
	•	Choices are always between the two classes they already have
	•	Partial splits do not exist:
	•	No level 13 / level 7 characters
	•	Progression is always in clean 10-level increments

⸻

Ability Structure & Progression Law (REFERENCE)
	•	Ability taxonomy:
	•	Spells
	•	Activated abilities
	•	Skills
	•	Passives
	•	Total ability counts, rotation structure, montage rules, and caps are defined in Module 6
	•	Module 12 governs progression flow, not ability math

⸻

No PvP Rule

Talvaren has no PvP.
This is permanent and absolute.

  <h2>Module 14 — Governance, Enforcement & Appeals</h2>
  MODULE 14 — Governance, Enforcement & Appeals

Define the world’s governance logic, enforcement boundaries, and appeal mechanisms.
This module governs process, not forgiveness.

⸻

	•	Requires deliberate, formal action
	•	Time and effort are intentional friction

⸻

3. Deep Delver Governance

3.1 Oath Authority
	•	Deep Delvers operate under a binding oath to Vallinoraxistup
	•	Governance is enforced by oath, not policy

3.2 Oath Violation Consequences

	•	No mitigation
	•	No review

⸻

4. Non-Appealable Offenses

These outcomes are absolute.

⸻

5. Governance Philosophy (Explicit)
	•	Governance is absolute

  <h2>Holding — Temp</h2>
  PATCH-HOLDING-OWNER-DECISIONS-001

Status: HOLDING — Parked, No Resolution Attempted

Scope: World Systems / Economy / Design Doctrine

⸻

1. Multi-Account Route Optimization

Affects: World Systems / Economy

Multi-account coordination used to:
	•	Observe caravan timing
	•	Optimize personal logistics
	•	Share route knowledge

This behavior is acknowledged and intentionally not restricted.

No systemic countermeasures are defined at this time.

Status: HOLDING

⸻

2. Safe Zone Camping Behavior

Affects: World Design / Zone Placement

Players may congregate at Safe Zones (including Caravan Route Posts) for:
	•	Comfort
	•	Safety
	•	Social or logistical reasons

Mitigation through world design choices (content placement, value density) is acknowledged but not systematized.

Status: HOLDING

⸻

3. Caravan-Edge Death Exploit (Edge Case)

Affects: Caravan Protection / Death Handling

Highly unlikely scenario:
	•	Player attempts to die intentionally at the boundary of caravan protection to probe respawn behavior

No explicit system guard is added at this time.

Status: HOLDING

⸻

4. Exploit & Emergent Play Doctrine

Affects: Design Doctrine (formerly Module 10 reference)

This doctrine:
	•	Governs design intent and evaluation only
	•	Introduces no mechanics
	•	Does not override rules unless explicitly referenced by a future patch

Status: HOLDING — Intent Layer Only

⸻

5. Material Costs for Spell Scrolls

Affects: Scribe Scroll Creation

Material requirements for spell scrolls are explicitly deferred:
	•	Reagents
	•	Quantities
	•	Rarity tiers
	•	Special components

To be defined in a later patch.

Status: HOLDING

⸻

6. Owner Decision Required — Parked Topics

No resolution attempted. Items are parked, not discarded.
	•	Final destination of mount travel routing logic (likely Module 4)
	•	Whether mount lists are duplicated in a global registry or referenced only
	•	Future interaction between mounts and caravans beyond logistics role

Status: HOLDING — OWNER DECISION REQUIRED

⸻

7. Canonical Overrides (Valid Patch Content)

These overrides are acknowledged as valid, but placement and integration remain pending.
	•	Mob taxonomy replaces prior tier-based assumptions
	•	Resistance system simplified to four categories
	•	Loot logic supersedes older humanoid / fauna drop rules
	•	Respawn logic overrides prior global respawn assumptions
	•	Unique item use-it-or-lose-it rule restated

Status: HOLDING — INTEGRATION PENDING

⸻

8. Owner Decision Required — Rule Placement Conflicts

No resolution attempted.
	•	Placement of Use-It-Or-Lose-It (10-day rule) vs existing global True Unique rule (possible overlap)
	•	Treatment of Halfling resistance modifier (race-based exception intersects Module 1A)
	•	Scope of Major NPC lootability vs governance / enforcement module

Status: HOLDING — OWNER DECISION REQUIRED

⸻

9. Additional Parked Interactions

No resolution attempted.
	•	Interaction between Wayfinder’s Beacon and teleport restrictions
	•	Scope of Deep Delver Markets relative to Vast Below governance
	•	Relationship between Zone Cluster soft bands and XP curve tables
	•	Status of UNIVERSAL PRINT FORMAT DIRECTIVE (process vs canon interaction)

“Kobold Lost-and-Found is flavor-only and intentionally non-mechanical.”

Status: HOLDING

⸻
