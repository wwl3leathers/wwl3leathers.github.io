  <h2>Module 1A — Player Core Systems</h2>
  MODULE 1A — Player Core Systems

Purpose

Rules that apply to all players, regardless of class.

⸻

1. Player Resources
	•	Health (HP) is not a spendable resource.
	•	Mana and Stamina are the only spendable resources.
	•	A character’s Primary Class determines which resource all abilities use.
	•	Movement actions may consume the primary resource.

⸻

2. Resource Bar Structure

Each spendable resource uses a Two-Bar System:
	•	Active Resource Bar
	•	Reserve Resource Bar (33% of maximum)

Rules:
	•	Resource expenditure draws from Reserve first
	•	No passive regeneration of Active or Reserve Bars
	•	Magical healing cannot restore the Reserve Bar
	•	Reserve refills only via:
	•	Consumables
	•	Safe Zones

When Reserve is empty → Cracked State
	•	Cracked resources cannot refill until Safe Zone access or consumable use.

⸻

3. Casting & Movement
	•	Cast Time = 0 → Instant Cast
	•	All Instant Cast abilities may be used while moving
	•	Any Cast Time greater than 0 requires stationary casting
	•	Cast time reduction cannot reduce below 0
	•	Instant cast status is binary (no partial movement)

Status: STRUCTURAL — Pending Final Reconfirmation

⸻

4. Universal Buff Rules
	•	Weak Buff → +15%
	•	Strong Buff → +45%

Rules:
	•	Buffs are category-based
	•	Buffs of the same category do not stack
	•	Reapplying a buff refreshes duration only
	•	Weak never upgrades to Strong
	•	Strong never downgrades to Weak

⸻

5. Mechanical Damage Types

Talvaren uses exactly four (4) mechanical damage types:
	•	Physical
	•	Magic
	•	Arcane
	•	Mental

All Mandala / elemental terms (Light, Fire, Ice, etc.) are flavor only and have no mechanical damage, resistance, or weakness math.

⸻

6. Damage Magnitude Placeholders

Each mechanical damage type uses four magnitude tiers:
	•	Weak
	•	Standard
	•	Strong
	•	Major

Rules:
	•	These are relative tiers, not numbers
	•	Numeric tuning is deferred to tables
	•	No stacking magnitude math
	•	No sub-tiers
	•	Same magnitude = same budget everywhere

⸻

7. Mental Damage Special Rule

Mental damage is effect-first, not damage-first.
	•	Deals minimal or zero HP damage
	•	Magnitudes define duration and severity, not damage

Tier meaning:
	•	Weak → very short, minor disruption
	•	Standard → short, meaningful disruption
	•	Strong → long, high-impact disruption
	•	Major → very long or encounter-defining effect

Mental effects still obey:
	•	No immunity rules
	•	CC-break rules
	•	Refresh-not-stack rules

⸻

8. Primary Resource Regeneration

Primary resources (Mana, Stamina) do not regenerate naturally.

There is:
	•	No passive regeneration
	•	No out-of-combat regeneration
	•	No stat-based regeneration
	•	No class-based regeneration

Resources are restored only via:
	•	Consumables
	•	Safe Zones

Status: ACTIVE — Unlocked for evaluation

⸻

9. Reserve Bar Regeneration

Status: OPEN DESIGN NOTE
	•	A very slow Reserve regeneration may be allowed in the future
	•	Not decided
	•	Not implemented
	•	Not implied

If allowed:
	•	Would be extremely slow
	•	Would never replace consumables
	•	Would never operate in combat
	•	Exists only to reduce hard-dead expedition states

⸻

10. Sprint & Movement Authority
	•	Sprint available at Level 1
	•	Sprint is an exertive action
	•	Sprint drains Active Stamina
	•	Sprint may drain Reserve
	•	Sprint never restores resources
	•	Sprint disabled if Stamina is Cracked
	•	Walking and normal movement remain free
	•	Encumbrance modifies stamina efficiency

No other module may redefine sprint behavior.

Status: STRUCTURAL — Pending Stress Testing

⸻

11. Dual-Class Rules
	•	Maximum of two classes per character
	•	Primary Class:
	•	Defines resource type
	•	Defines scaling model
	•	Secondary Class:
	•	Grants abilities only

All abilities use the Primary Resource.

⸻

12. Primary Resource Law
	•	HP is a life resource only
	•	No ability ever costs HP
	•	HP loss occurs only through damage or world consequences

There are:
	•	No mixed-cost abilities
	•	No dual-resource abilities
	•	No exceptions

⸻

13. Primary Resource Class Split (LOCKED)

Mana-Primary Classes (8):
	•	Wizard
	•	Necromancer
	•	Druid
	•	Priest
	•	Jeweler
	•	Alchemist
	•	Tailor
	•	Scribe

	•	Executioner
	•	Rogue
	•	Smith
	•	Cook
	•	Laborer
	•	Tamer

All abilities — combat, utility, profession, and dual-class — consume the primary resource.

⸻

14. Core Stats & Progression Rules
	•	Six primary stats: STR, CON, DEX, INT, WIS, ART
	•	Beginning stats depend on size; “Average” begins at 8
	•	Level 1:
	•	+20 stat points
	•	Size-based min/max apply (Level 1 only)
	•	Post-Level 1:
	•	+2 stat points per level
	•	Max +1 per stat per level
	•	No stat caps

Attribute effects are per-point, not per-level.

⸻

15. Attribute Effects (Per Point)
	•	STR → Stamina Max
	•	WIS → Mana Max
	•	ART → Stamina efficiency + Stamina Max
	•	CON → HP per point (retroactive)
	•	DEX → Physical mitigation
	•	INT → Spell interaction logic

⸻

16. Safe Zones
	•	Allow recovery and logistical action
	•	Do not prevent consequences

Aggro rules:
	•	A mob pulled into a Safe Zone remains aggroed only to:
	•	The pulling player
	•	Any players who attack it or heal attackers

⸻

17. Literacy & UI Gates
	•	INT ≤ 10 → Cannot read
	•	INT ≥ 11 → Literacy enabled
	•	WIS < 11 → Compass disabled
	•	Symbol-based signage still functions

⸻

18. Scrolls & Writs

Scrolls

	•	Non-magical systemic documents
	•	Do not consume mana

Rules:
	•	Scrolls and writs are categorically distinct
	•	No item may function as both
	•	Scrolls and writs cannot be chained

⸻

19. Death & Soul Logic
	•	Spirit Wells:
	•	Resurrection
	•	Identification access
	•	Map study
	•	Graveyards
	•	Two bindable respawn locations (primary + secondary)

⸻

20. Field Kit (Universal Slot)
	•	All characters possess one Field Kit slot
	•	Universal, class-agnostic
	•	Not gear, inventory, or weapon
	•	World-interaction utility only

Field Pull System
	•	Once per 3-hour in-game day:
	•	Grants one random utility consumable
	•	Low quality
	•	Single-use
	•	Non-scaling
	•	Non-sellable
	•	Non-damaging
	•	No combat debuffs
	•	May stack naturally

Constraints:
	•	No stat bonuses
	•	No durability repair
	•	Does not replace Smith repairs or towns
	•	Professions may unlock interactions through it

Fishing Pole is the only equip-required tool unless patched.

⸻

21. Encumbrance Authority Clarification
	•	Equipment defines weight
	•	Player systems define consequences
	•	No equipment module may define stamina regeneration or sprint rules

⸻

Status Summary
	•	Locked: Primary Resource Class Split
	•	Active (Unlocked): Resource Regeneration Rule

  <h2>Module 4 — World Geography & Biomes</h2>
  MODULE 4 — World Geography & Biomes

(AUTHORITATIVE SUPPORTING RECORD — NON-GAMEPLAY)

Purpose

Identify all assumptions, dependencies, exclusions, and “silent rules” that affect Module 4 — World Geography & Biomes, but are defined elsewhere.

This document:
	•	Introduces no mechanics
	•	Defines no systems
	•	Exists to prevent accidental rule injection, duplication, or contradiction

⸻

1. GLOBAL RULE DEPENDENCIES (ASSUMED, NOT DEFINED HERE)

Module 4 assumes the following global laws exist without redefining them.

1.1 Caravan Route Immutability
	•	Caravan routes:
	•	Are never delayed, damaged, destroyed, or blocked
	•	Dynamically route around hazards
	•	Module 4 relies on caravan rhythm and compatibility
	•	The immutability rule lives in global travel canon
	•	❗ If omitted elsewhere, travel logic breaks

⸻

1.2 No PvP Rule
	•	Module 4 geography, safe zones, and camps assume:
	•	Zero PvP
	•	No territorial grief mechanics
	•	This rule is not declared in Module 4

  MODULE 7 — Non-Magic Abilities & Skills

(Structural rules only; no class-specific lists yet)

ABILITY PROGRESSION — GLOBAL RULES
	•	Each class has up to 48 total abilities by Level 61.
	•	Ability totals and grant pacing are defined in Module 6.
	•	Abilities are intentionally divisible by 8, reinforcing Talvaren’s core cosmology.
	•	Ability categories are universal:
	•	Spells
	•	Activated Abilities
	•	Skills
	•	Passives
	•	Players may hotbar as many abilities as they want.
	•	The system does not protect players from complexity; choice is celebrated.

⸻

DESTINATION: Module 7 — Non-Magic Abilities & Skills

CORE ROTATION RULE (KISS — HARD)

Each class has exactly 4 core rotational actions:
	1.	1 Basic action (always usable)
	2.	2 Setup / Builder actions
	3.	1 Maintenance action

Rules:
	•	No secondary resource systems exist.
	•	No rage bars, fury meters, elemental buildup, counters, or stacks.
	•	Only primary resources exist (stamina, mana, health).
	•	Core rotation is intentionally simple; depth comes from situational and optional abilities.

⸻

NO RETROACTIVE ACCESS RULE — ADVENTURERS
	•	Dual-classing never grants access to levels 1–10 abilities of the second class.
	•	Example:
	•	A Level 10 Rogue who dual-classes into Warrior:
	•	Keeps Rogue 1–10 abilities
	•	Gains Warrior abilities only from levels 11–60
	•	A Warrior who started as Warrior has access to Warrior abilities from levels 1–60.
	•	These characters are intentionally asymmetric.

	•	Fauna: passive; tiered meat drops (T1–T5).
	•	Humanoids: aggressive; drop coins, weapons, gear, rare profession resources.
	•	Apex / Lieutenants: high-difficulty, unique drops, long respawns.
	•	Boss / Apex / Lieutenant Rule References
	•	Bosses: scripted Apex encounters; multi-phase; short CC only; environmental mechanics; drops include high-tier crafting materials and Mandala reagents.
	•	Lieutenants: persistent route patrol threats; death temporarily weakens patrols; respawn via world pressure logic.
	•	Chaos-Touched: random corruption of Common/Elite only; gains 1 mechanic, stat delta, behavior mutation; visual corruption; used to break farming patterns.
	•	Vast Below Enemy Structure (behavioral tier relation)
	•	VB Common = Surface Elite.
	•	VB Elite = Surface Mini-Boss.
	•	VB Apex = world-altering threat.
	•	Overfarming increases patrols, elite spawn, Chaos-Touched probability.

  <h2>Module 12 — Progression, XP & Caps</h2>
  ✅ MODULE 12 — Progression, XP & Caps (CORRECTED)

Ability Grant Milestones — FINALIZED (AUTHORITATIVE VIA MODULE 6)
	•	Ability grants occur at Effective Levels:
	•	Level 11
	•	Level 21
	•	Level 31
	•	Level 41
	•	Level 51
	•	Level 61
	•	Level 61 abilities are:
	•	Intentionally high-impact
	•	Identity-defining
	•	Not numerical scaling rewards

Ability totals, per-level grants, and caps are defined in Module 6 and referenced here for progression context only.

This replaces the earlier 11/22/33/44/55 pattern.

⸻

Dual-Class On-Ramp Clarification
	•	Secondary class always enters at the next Effective Level
	•	This intentionally skips Level 1 of the secondary class
	•	This ensures dual-class characters:
	•	Are never ability-starved
	•	Immediately gain access to new class tools

Fully consistent and aligned with Module 6 effective-level math.

⸻

Progression Structure (world scale)
	•	Zone clusters span 20–25 levels
	•	Distribution rule:
	•	1× level 60 → 3× level 50 zones
	•	1× level 50 → 3× level 40 zones
	•	Entire game playable via underground alone
	•	Ocean progression is lateral only
	•	No endgame region exists
	•	Polar continents exceed standard world cap

⸻

Reward Law (progression link)
	•	Permanent one-time biome stat gain encounters exist (see Module 4)
	•	Zone-relative danger scaling (not player-level based)

⸻

Vendor crafting limit (scope note)
	•	Profession vendors sell Common-grade basic resources only
	•	Inventory limited strictly to Module 13 registry
	•	Laborer and Tamer vendors sell none

⸻

LEVEL PROGRESSION — GLOBAL RULES
	•	Maximum level: 61
	•	No PvP exists in Talvaren. Ever.
	•	Difficulty, tension, and mastery come exclusively from the world and its systems
	•	Player choice is prioritized over optimization enforcement

⸻

ABILITY UNLOCK TIMING — HARD (REFERENCE ONLY)
	•	Ability pacing, totals, and caps are defined in Module 6
	•	This module governs when choices occur, not how many abilities exist

Any numeric ability counts listed below are contextual milestones and must not override Module 6.

⸻

PRIMARY CLASS RULE — ADVENTURERS
	•	A player’s first class choice is permanent and is their Primary Class
	•	Primary Class defines identity and early training forever

By Level 10:
	•	Adventurers receive 8 class-defining abilities from their Primary Class
	•	These form the irreversible core of the character

⸻

LEVEL 10 HARD CHOICE — ADVENTURERS

At Level 10, Adventurers face a mandatory, blocking choice:
	•	The choice window does not expire
	•	Progression halts until a decision is made
	•	Combat state does not bypass the choice

Choices:
	1.	Continue leveling the Primary Class
	2.	Dual-class into any other available class

⸻

DUAL-CLASSING RULES — ADVENTURERS (HARD)
	•	Dual-classing occurs in fixed 10-level blocks
	•	Players are locked into their class choice for the next 10 levels
	•	At the end of each 10-level block, the player chooses again
	•	Choices are always between the two classes they already have
	•	Partial splits do not exist:
	•	No level 13 / level 7 characters
	•	Progression is always in clean 10-level increments

⸻

Ability Structure & Progression Law (REFERENCE)
	•	Ability taxonomy:
	•	Spells
	•	Activated abilities
	•	Skills
	•	Passives
	•	Total ability counts, rotation structure, montage rules, and caps are defined in Module 6
	•	Module 12 governs progression flow, not ability math

⸻

No PvP Rule

Talvaren has no PvP.
This is permanent and absolute.

  <h2>Module 14 — Governance, Enforcement & Appeals</h2>
  MODULE 14 — Governance, Enforcement & Appeals

Purpose

Define the world’s governance logic, enforcement boundaries, and appeal mechanisms.
This module governs process, not forgiveness.

⸻

1. Appeals System (World Process)

	•	There is no grind-based reputation repair

Rules
	•	Each offense requires a new appeal
	•	Appeals cannot be:

	•	Batched

⸻

2. Reputation Repair Constraints
	•	Reputation repair:
	•	Is never passive
	•	Is never grind-based
	•	Requires deliberate, formal action
	•	Time and effort are intentional friction

⸻

3. Deep Delver Governance

3.1 Oath Authority
	•	Deep Delvers operate under a binding oath to Vallinoraxistup
	•	Governance is enforced by oath, not policy

3.2 Oath Violation Consequences
	•	Violation of oath results in:
	•	Annihilation
	•	No appeal
	•	No mitigation
	•	No review

⸻

4. Non-Appealable Offenses

No appeals exist for:
	•	True Unique theft
	•	Oath violation
	•	Hoard crimes

These outcomes are absolute.

⸻

5. Governance Philosophy (Explicit)
	•	Governance is absolute
	•	Forgiveness is not a system

⸻

Status
	•	Authoritative
	•	Player-facing where applicable

  <h2>Holding — Temp</h2>
  PATCH-HOLDING-OWNER-DECISIONS-001

Status: HOLDING — Parked, No Resolution Attempted

Scope: World Systems / Economy / Design Doctrine

⸻

1. Multi-Account Route Optimization

Affects: World Systems / Economy

Multi-account coordination used to:
	•	Observe caravan timing
	•	Optimize personal logistics
	•	Share route knowledge

This behavior is acknowledged and intentionally not restricted.

No systemic countermeasures are defined at this time.

Status: HOLDING

⸻

2. Safe Zone Camping Behavior

Affects: World Design / Zone Placement

Players may congregate at Safe Zones (including Caravan Route Posts) for:
	•	Comfort
	•	Safety
	•	Social or logistical reasons

Mitigation through world design choices (content placement, value density) is acknowledged but not systematized.

Status: HOLDING

⸻

3. Caravan-Edge Death Exploit (Edge Case)

Affects: Caravan Protection / Death Handling

Highly unlikely scenario:
	•	Player attempts to die intentionally at the boundary of caravan protection to probe respawn behavior

No explicit system guard is added at this time.

Status: HOLDING

⸻

4. Exploit & Emergent Play Doctrine

Affects: Design Doctrine (formerly Module 10 reference)

This doctrine:
	•	Governs design intent and evaluation only
	•	Introduces no mechanics
	•	Does not override rules unless explicitly referenced by a future patch

Status: HOLDING — Intent Layer Only

⸻

5. Material Costs for Spell Scrolls

Affects: Scribe Scroll Creation

Material requirements for spell scrolls are explicitly deferred:
	•	Reagents
	•	Quantities
	•	Rarity tiers
	•	Special components

To be defined in a later patch.

Status: HOLDING

⸻

6. Owner Decision Required — Parked Topics

No resolution attempted. Items are parked, not discarded.
	•	Final destination of mount travel routing logic (likely Module 4)
	•	Whether mount lists are duplicated in a global registry or referenced only
	•	Future interaction between mounts and caravans beyond logistics role

Status: HOLDING — OWNER DECISION REQUIRED

⸻

7. Canonical Overrides (Valid Patch Content)

These overrides are acknowledged as valid, but placement and integration remain pending.
	•	Mob taxonomy replaces prior tier-based assumptions
	•	Resistance system simplified to four categories
	•	Loot logic supersedes older humanoid / fauna drop rules
	•	Respawn logic overrides prior global respawn assumptions
	•	Unique item use-it-or-lose-it rule restated

Status: HOLDING — INTEGRATION PENDING

⸻

8. Owner Decision Required — Rule Placement Conflicts

No resolution attempted.
	•	Placement of Use-It-Or-Lose-It (10-day rule) vs existing global True Unique rule (possible overlap)
	•	Treatment of Halfling resistance modifier (race-based exception intersects Module 1A)
	•	Scope of Major NPC lootability vs governance / enforcement module

Status: HOLDING — OWNER DECISION REQUIRED

⸻

9. Additional Parked Interactions

No resolution attempted.
	•	Interaction between Wayfinder’s Beacon and teleport restrictions
	•	Scope of Deep Delver Markets relative to Vast Below governance
	•	Relationship between Zone Cluster soft bands and XP curve tables
	•	Status of UNIVERSAL PRINT FORMAT DIRECTIVE (process vs canon interaction)

“Kobold Lost-and-Found is flavor-only and intentionally non-mechanical.”

Status: HOLDING

⸻

HOLDING SUMMARY
	•	This section contains no active mechanics
	•	It preserves:
	•	Known edge cases
	•	Owner decisions
	•	Deferred integrations
	•	Design doctrine
	•	Nothing here is implied, enforced, or implemented
